                                  with public keys of the components) . This config file is optional

    * /etc/copilot/copilot-jobmanager-generic.conf- contains configuraion specific to the given component (e.g. JobManager.conf contains the Jabber  
			                            ID of the Job Manager component)
    */etc/copilot/copilot-storagemanager-panda.conf - contains configuration specific to the giver component (eg. user to run panda data movement)
Each configuration directive in a file is preceded by the comment, which describes the given configuration directive. Configuration
directives from Copilot.conf can be ovveriden inside component configuration file.
